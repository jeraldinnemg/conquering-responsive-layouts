## Some useful lessons I've learned

1. Most of the elements are responsive by default. :heavy_check_mark:
2. When we donÂ´t assign a width to anything layout is responsive. Try it!.:bulb:
3. If you specify height, the most part you'll cause more issues than solutions.:dart:
4. Em vs Rem?: Rem is more consistent, em is in relation with parents.:heavy_check_mark:
5. Use rem for specify css properties like font-size instead use em for specify css properties like margin or padding.:bulb:
6. Relative units are useful for responsive layouts.:heavy_check_mark:
7. Setting vw in font-size is useful in tittles.:bulb:
8. Flexbox basics: What happens when you make display flex, the columns are going to try and shrink to their minimun possible size:dart:
9. Reduce as much as possible the amount of HTML needed.:heavy_check_mark:
10. Ensure the image is responsive, one trick is to declare image's css property "max-width:100px". :bulb:
11. An option to gao could be margin-right or margin-left.:dart:
12. By default flex shrink is on.:heavy_check_mark:
13. Centering things the easy way "margin: 0 auto".:bulb:
